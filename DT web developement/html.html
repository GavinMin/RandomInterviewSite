        <h1>What?</h1>
        <p>One question asked by many is "What is an internship?". An internship, is the act of working at a business for not money but experience</p>
        <p>That is the main point of this project, I would like to get people to start experiencing their jobs head-on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col four left">
        <h1>How?</h1>
        <p>I am hoping to at some point get a sign up going for getting into internships from here at LEAD and possibly highschools starting FRESHMAN year.(preferably a website)</p>
        <p>I'll probably do this by running a database of all types of jobs at Kansas City and the age requirements to intern at them and how many they want/need.</p>
        <p>I believe that with a little bit of learning and help I can make this a definite possibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col four left">
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>Why internships you ask? Well that is extrememly simple reasoning</p>
        <p>Getting people into internships can be wildly beneficial. It can be fun, ensightful, and preparing. By showing students what workspaces are like outside of school can prepare them for the real life after highschool, or even college.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col four left">
        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>Doing this is going to require a lot of help, and is going to affect many people, here is a list.
        <ul>
          <li>The whole student body here at LEAD</li>
          <li>The facilitators</li>
          <li>Central Office</li>
          <li>Dr. Stanley</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>

      <div class="col one left">
        <h1 class="bottom">You?</h1>
        <p class="bottom">Well, what am I going to do?</p>
        <p class="bottom">I personally am going to start to talk to people I know, or start researching about web development as a teen. I also am looking into internships and joining some coding meetups, I know of some that are in Kansas City that happen annually and monthly.</p>
